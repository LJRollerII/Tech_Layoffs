# Tech Layoffs

# Background

When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the tech industry experienced an economic slow down. Due to slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks, and strong dollars overseas hinting towards possible recession, tech firms have started laying employees off. Companies such as Meta, Amazon, and Twitter have laid off a significant percentage of their employees and this trend does not seem to be stopping anytime soon.

# Project Aim

Explore and analyze the data to see if we find any patterns, trends, or interesting information regarding the tech layoffs.

*<u>Note</u>*: Data collected and analyzed for this project is from March 11, 2020 to November 16, 2022.
